A python script that can play Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!!'s days all by itself. Currently, supports 75% of the food types.
After I finish adding them, I plan on making it navigate the menus all by itself as well. DOES NOT WORK IF UNLESS YOUR SCREEN BRIGHTNESS IS SET TO 100%.
ALSO DOES NOT WORK WHEN HDR IS ENABLED. Currently, supports only 2560x1440 resolution. If you want to use it on a different resolution, you will have to change the coordinates in the script.
I will make it so that it can work on any resolution in the future.
